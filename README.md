## Project Description and Deliverables

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The project requirements are:

 - Submit a tidy data set.
 - Submit a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis.
 - Submit a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.  The code book explains how all the scripts work and how they are connected.
 - Submit a README.md (this file) in the repo with your scripts.
 - Analysis R script.
